# Pig Game
Welcome to Pig Game, a simple two-player game where each player takes turns rolling a die and accumulating points. The objective is to be the first player to reach a designated score (100).

# How to Play
To play the game, simply download the source code and run the pig_game.py file in your JS environment.

On a player's turn, they can choose to roll the die as many times as they want, accumulating points with each roll. However, if they roll a 1, they lose all of their accumulated points for that turn and their turn ends. At any point, the player can choose to hold their current score and end their turn, adding their points to their overall score.

The game will continue until one player reaches the target score, at which point they will be declared the winner.
